To compile the assembler I used the command
gcc -o assembler assembler.c assembler.h instructions.c opcode.c data.c binary.c
./assembler "test-suite/sample.slk" 
~ I replaced "sample.slk" with whichever input file I used, for example s1.slk, s2.slk and so forth

To compile the simulator I used the command
gcc -o simulator simulator.c
./sim "test-suite/sample.slko" 
~ if the input file was s1.slk the output would be s1.slko
